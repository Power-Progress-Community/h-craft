I got this openal-soft version from: 
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/ewing/openal-soft-apportable

Don't know if it's better than the other apportable version found on the web - but this one looked like it 
has more active development and even comes with Android.mk already.

Also it should probably rather be a hg subrepository. But before I do that I have to re-think the way
H-Craft is handling library dependencies right now.
